Create an infographic illustrating the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. Highlight steps like writing tests before code, benefits such as bug reduction, and how it fosters software reliability.

Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Section 1: Introduction to TDD:
-------------------------------
- What is TDD?
  - A software development methodology where tests are written before the code itself.
  - Ensures that the codebase is continuously tested and validated.

Section 2: The TDD Cycle
------------------------
1. Write a Test
   - Write a small test for the new feature or functionality before writing any code.
   - The test should fail initially since the functionality is not yet implemented.

2. Run All Tests
   - Run all tests to ensure that the new test fails (which is expected).
   - *Icon*: Play Button Icon
3. Write Code
   - Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
   - Focus on getting the test to pass, not on optimization.
   - *Icon*: Code Icon
4. Run Tests Again
   - Run all tests again to ensure that the new code passes the test.
   - *Icon*: Checkmark Icon
5. Refactor
   - Refactor the new code to improve its structure without changing its behavior.
   - Run the tests again to ensure nothing is broken.
   - *Icon*: Wrench Icon
6. Repeat
   - Continue the cycle for each new feature or functionality.
   - *Icon*: Repeat Icon

 Section 3: Benefits of TDD
----------------------------
- Reduction in Bugs
  - Identifies defects early in the development process.
  - Icon: Bug Icon
- Improved Code Quality
  - Results in cleaner, more maintainable code.
  - Icon: Thumbs Up Icon
- Reliable Software
  - Ensures that code changes do not break existing functionality.
  - Icon: Shield Icon
- Documentation
  - Tests serve as a form of documentation for the code.
  - *Icon*: Document Icon

Section 4: Visual Flow of TDD Process
- Diagram: A cyclical flowchart illustrating the steps (Write Test → Run Tests → Write Code → Run Tests → Refactor → Repeat).

Visual Design:
- Colors: Use a palette with 2-3 complementary colors.
- Icons: Simple, flat icons to represent each step.
- Fonts: Clear, readable fonts with varying weights for headings and body text.
- Layout: Ensure a clean, organized layout with distinct sections.
