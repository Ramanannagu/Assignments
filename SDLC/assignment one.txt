Title: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
=============================================

 Introduction:
---------------
A brief introduction to the SDLC, explaining it as a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

---
 Phases of SDLC:

1. Requirements
-----------------
    - *Importance*: Gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.
    - *Activities*: Stakeholder interviews, requirement workshops, creating requirement specifications.
    - *Outcome*: Requirement Specification Document (RSD).
    - *Interconnection*: Sets the foundation for the design phase.

2. Design
----------
    - *Importance*: Translating requirements into detailed architectural and design specifications.
    - *Activities*: System design, database design, user interface design, creation of design documents.
    - *Outcome*: Design Specification Document (DSD), prototypes.
    - *Interconnection*: Provides a blueprint for the implementation phase.

3. Implementation
-------------------
    - *Importance*: Actual coding of the software application according to the design specifications.
    - *Activities*: Writing code, source code management, creating databases.
    - *Outcome*: Source Code, executable software modules.
    - *Interconnection*: Development of software components to be tested in the next phase.

4. Testing
------------
    - *Importance*: Ensuring the software functions as intended and is free of defects.
    - *Activities*: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing.
    - *Outcome*: Test reports, defect logs.
    - *Interconnection*: Verifies that the implemented software meets the design and requirements before deployment.

5. Deployment
---------------
    - *Importance*: Releasing the software to production and ensuring it operates in the live environment.
    - *Activities*: Deployment planning, release management, monitoring and support.
    - *Outcome*: Deployed software, user training manuals.
    - *Interconnection*: Marks the transition from development to operation, enabling end-users to use the software.

Visual Representation:
-----------------------

- *Flowchart or Circular Diagram*: Show the phases in a sequential or cyclical manner, highlighting the continuous nature of the process.
- *Icons and Colors*: Use distinct icons and colors for each phase to make it visually appealing.
- *Connecting Arrows*: Illustrate how each phase feeds into the next, emphasizing the interconnections.

---
 Additional Elements:
-----------------------
- *Title*: Make it bold and clear at the top.
- *Subheadings*: Use different font sizes and weights for each phase.
- *Visual Balance*: Ensure there is enough white space to avoid clutter.
