   Example: A high-speed internet connection with a bandwidth of 100 Mbps.

Router:
 
 A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.Routers allow devices to connect and share data over the Internet or an intranet. A router is a      gateway that passes data between one or more local area networks 
Example:when a user sends a request for a server, the router on the local network will examine its routing table and decide where to relay the data.


MAC Address:

   Definition: A hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network.
   Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.
