1. Modem/Router*: This device connects to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) and serves as the gateway to the internet. It often has built-in routing and firewall functionalities.
2. Wireless Access Point (AP)*: This provides wireless connectivity to devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
3. Ethernet Switch*: This connects multiple wired devices, such as desktops and Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, allowing them to communicate within the network.


### Accessing the RPS Lab Environment
=====================================

1. Secure Internet Connection*: Ensure your device (e.g., laptop or desktop) is connected to the internet via the modem/router.

2. VPN (Virtual Private Network)*: Establish a secure VPN connection to the lab network. This provides a secure and encrypted tunnel for your data, ensuring privacy and security.

3. Remote Desktop or SSH*: Depending on the lab environment, you might use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for a graphical interface or Secure Shell (SSH) for command-line access. This allows you to control and interact with the lab's systems as if you were physically present.
